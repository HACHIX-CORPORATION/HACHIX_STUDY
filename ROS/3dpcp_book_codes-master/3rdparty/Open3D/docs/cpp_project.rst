Link Open3D in C++ projects
---------------------------

We provide two example CMake projects to demonstrate how to use Open3D in your
CMake projects.

* `Find Pre-Installed Open3D Package in CMake <https://github.com/isl-org/open3d-cmake-find-package>`_
  This option can be used if you'd like Open3D build and install Open3D first,
  then link your project to Open3D.
* `Use Open3D as a CMake External Project <https://github.com/isl-org/open3d-cmake-external-project>`_
  This option can be used if you'd like Open3D to build alongside with your
  project.

For instructions on how to compile Open3D from source, checkout :ref:`compilation`.
